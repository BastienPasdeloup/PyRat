Workspace API
=============

PyRat comes with a workspace that you should use to start working on your games.
It is created with the function ``pyrat.create_workspace()`` that we ask you to run in the installation instructions.
This workspace contains two directories: one to store your games and one to store your players.
You can later add more directories if you want to organize your workspace differently.
